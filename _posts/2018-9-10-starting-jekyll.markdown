I first knew about Jekyll 5 years ago when I was in university. My Computer Science friend mentioned in Twitter about how excited he was to use Jekyll.

Fast forward 5 years, I'm thinking that it might be good to have a simple personal blog to record down my learning journey. Sometimes years passed by in a blink. I hope by recording down stuff here, I can look back and reflect on things that I have learned so far.
