Let's try to brainstorm on the design of the whole thing.

I would like the whole thing to only take 10-15 minutes. I think it's more "bite-sized" that way.

From the main screen, maybe we can start with the traditional idea about gender that would make people nod their head or furrow their eyebrows. If possible, I'd like to make the whole experience more personal, so I think it's important to ask the user to identify themselves.


Maybe I can start with the traditional view on gender role.

And end it with a question, "Are you a boy or a girl?"

Then we can move on to the explanations that gender is not a binary thing.

And at the end of the explanation, they can play around with the spectrum slider where it will generate different labels based on their input.

As the closing, it will be nice to pose them a thought-provoking question so they can reflect on it.

Since the whole thing does not need to be very fancy, I'm going to use Vue for the UI framework. The only problem is there's no designer / illustrator ^_^;
