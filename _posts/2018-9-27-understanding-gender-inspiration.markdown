Understanding Gender is my new pet project under Explorable Explanations. 

A few weeks ago, I had a trip to Bangkok with my friends and we visited Museum Siam, which was under renovation recently. There was a temporary exhibition on Gender Diversity and it was very interesting.

The exhibition touched on the spectrum of gender and sexuality. Thailand is famous for the existence of the "ladyboy", boys who dress as girls and usually they are so pretty that you won't be able to tell. The temporary exhibition aims to educate the public on the myths surrounding the LGBTQ+ community.

Traditionally, people would consider gender as two types: boy and girl.
If you're born with a penis, you're a boy. If you're born with a vagina, you're a girl. If you're a boy, you would be interested in girls, and here is a set of stereotypes on how you should behave.

Turns out it's not as simple as that. 
Gender is a combination of multiple dimensions: sex, identity, and expression (do take note that sexuality / attraction is separate from gender)

Apparently, even these dimensions are not black and white. They're not binary. They're not either 0 or 1. They're a spectrum.

I personally think that there are still a lot of people who don't know about this and they deem the LGBTQ+ community as strange / weird. I know there are still so many people in Indonesia who consider homosexuality as a mental illness that can be cured. 

Hence, I think I would like to make a pet project titled "Understanding Gender", which will be an [Explorable Explanations](https://explorabl.es/) about the gender spectrum.

I consider this temporary exhibition as a brave move from the Thai government. With this, the government is clearly making a stand that they're supporting the LGBTQ+ community and this is their direction for the country. In comparison, Singapore is still persistent in keeping the sodomy law, and Indonesia is geting more and more hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community.
