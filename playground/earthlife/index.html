            I participated in a 3-month bootcamp program organised by
            <a href="http://www.techladies.co/" target="_blank"
              >TechLadies community</a
            >. TechLadies is a community-led initiative for women to connect, learn and advance as programmers.

            As a team comprised of three coaches and three students, we were
            tasked to work with an NGO from Earthfest Singapore to build a quiz
            app that we call "Earthlife".
          </p>
          <p>
            The quiz app is supposed to raise awareness on how earth-friendly
            you are, and by the end of it, a to-do list is generated for you to
            achieve a greener life.
